## Brief and Rationale
Since my Javascript code was very long, I decided to implement jQuery features that reduce some of the complicated Javascript features. It is mostly switching from Javascript's innerHTML to append in jQuery. Since a lot of my Javascript code uses this innerHTML feature, consider my Javascript and jQuery code to be one thing.

## Learning outcome
Learned how to properly utilize Javascript features and implement them into a dynamically changing HTML website. The use of classes were super helpful in maintaining neat access to objects and ensuring functions are easy to create.

## What went well and what didnâ€™t
I was able to implement both of my ideas almost exactly as I wanted and the innerHTML feature was extremely helpful in ensuring that I was able to do so. While I would have also liked to complete the graph idea, I was not able to find proper code to help with me that, perhaps some API exists for that and I could attempt that in Unit 7.

## What I would do differently
I would try to have forms in each page using and POST and GET to pass information instead of the URL parsing method that I used which was unnecessarily complicated.
