## Brief
Wrote CSS code for my website to give it a better and more interactive website look. The updated website, which has been tested by viewing each page, can be viewed at http://student.athabascau.ca/~khizarsi/

## Rationale
I designed my pages keeping in mind my initial mockup while making changes along the way to increase accessibility and visibility of website content to better showcase to the personas. The chosen color scheme (blue focused) was selected to make it consistent with the colors of the NBA logo.

## Learning outcome
I learned how to properly style HTML elements in CSS by modifying specific classes and ids as well as general components. As a result of these CSS modifications, I was able to learn how to properly arrange components in a box format and make content stand out in a simple webpage.

## What went well and what didnâ€™t
Most of the simple CSS was straightforward (font size, color, background color) and I was even able to create a cool navbar along with some great hover options. I wasn't running into too many class/id problems as I constructed those well and in a large amount in my HTML code, however arranging certain components specifically the stats and bio page of the players took a little extra time to figure out. In addition, I learned the navbar at the top of each page was not constructible with the HTML code I had previously so I had to slightly change it by wrapping the options in a list item selector tag.

## What I would do differently
I would keep in mind the capabilities of the CSS features that I've learned to better construct my HTML code with. For instance, the refactoring of the navbar HTML code. I would also add color to my mockup when designing it so I don't waste extra time deciding a color scheme for the website when I write my CSS.
