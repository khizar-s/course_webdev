## Brief
Chose the theme and purpose for my website. Created personas and scenarios for the website to show potential uses. Created a website mock-up and site map to show all the features of the website.

## Rationale
For my target audience, I tried going over common careers, age groups and backgrounds in the sports field. From this I added a variety of backgrounds and names appropriate to the respective backgrounds. Then I made sure to add related goals and scenarios for each person to come up with a list of potential candidates.

## Learning outcome
I identified the potential audience and website purposes in each persona scenario. For the website, I made sure to design pages that would help the personas in their scenarios. Each page included a user-friendly design to go along with helpful features. The website is minimalistic as seen in the site map and accessible as seen in each page mock-up.

## What went well and what didnâ€™t
The website design went well for the most part, I was not able to identify any troubles during the design of the website and everything was smooth.

## What I would do differently
One thing I would improve is my website idea itself. I was torn between creating a personal website and the one I have currently. The lack of persona scenarios for the personal website led me to choose the NBAinfo website but I feel like I could have done a better job deciding the website topic.
