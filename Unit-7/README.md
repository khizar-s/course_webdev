## Brief and Rationale
I used the API service provided by BallDontLie which can be viewed at https://www.balldontlie.io. From this website, I utilized 2 APIs: One for getting player information and one for getting player stats. This will be super helpful for the personas as the API aims to provide accurate and up to date information on players instead of standard placeholder values

## Learning outcome
Learned how to use an API to acquire useful information and parse it with Javascript and jQuery so that it can be displayed in an HTML page.

## What went well and what didnâ€™t
I was able to implement the player bio and statistics very well. However, the team information API I was eyeing to piece together my website into a full functioning resource was extremely hard to work with and given I had limited time, I chose to abandon that feature and focus on the player information instead.

## What I would do differently
Now that I'm familiar with APIs, I would probably try to see if I can access future APIs easily and work with them to an extent. That way I'd avoid having to run into issues where I have to drop or change APIs to get my website to work.
