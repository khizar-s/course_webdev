## Brief
Wrote the base HTML code for my pages while doing my research on multiple APIs to be used for the Javascript portion. Also fully tested out my website by going through all pages and their features. The website pages can be seen at http://student.athabascau.ca/~khizarsi/

## Rationale
I chose my pages according to the site mockup I designed with the addition of a Contact page that could be used to contact me for any reason. I also decided to reduce some features as they could not be duplicated by APIs as well as make my site content/data auto generated through the mentioned APIs. The pages I have created showcase team schedules, stats, performance over the years, roster info as well as player bio, stats and performance all of which is vital information for the personas to access for their own reasons.

## Learning outcome
I learned how to properly create HTML pages as well as the various content they can create. I was surprised by the amount of site variation I was able to do without the use of CSS which includes forms, lists, tables, selection statements all of which I was able to learn and implement. I also spent a lot of time learning how to best structure my pages and whether to include or exclude certain features to match the template of the website as a whole

## What went well and what didnâ€™t
The website code did not take that long to complete and most of the features from the site map were included into the web pages, I was also able to find APIs to auto generate my data with current information which saved me the trouble of having to write up thousands of lines of data, and updated every day/week. However, not all of the features were found through APIs and I ended up having to scrap those designs in the web pages. There were also a lot of times I had to search the limitations of HTML to see whether my features were capable of implementation or whether I had to wait for the Javascript module. Lastly, in the case there are some features not implementable, I have no choice but to set default code for them which will fit the site mockup but is not satisfying coming from someone who designed it to be an accurate representation

## What I would do differently
If I could restart, I would go and change my site mockup to include less statistical data to reduce being so reliant on APIs. I would also probably choose a website idea that utlizes more text so I could play around with more heading types and text formatting rather than pure data. 

## Critique
### Sample 1
- No title in the head -> Add meaningful title
- No !DOCTYPE tag -> Add !DOCTYPE to first line
- No meta specified -> Specify some meta for charset
- Header tages not consistent -> "H1" should be "h1" and so on
- Multiple instances of no closing tag -> Add closing tag for p, h2, h3
- "and more" is a list item without a list -> Move closing tag for list to after "and more"
- Image doesn't load -> Fix source of image as well as add an alternate text
- Bad use of the table -> Use the table for data
- Tags start at the beginning of each line -> Add indenting to make it more meaningful

### Sample 2
- Title document makes no sense -> Make title more descriptive
- Body has no text -> Add some text to the body
